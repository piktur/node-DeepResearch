# DeepResearch

[Official UI](https://search.jina.ai/) | [UI Code](https://github.com/jina-ai/deepsearch-ui) | [Official API](https://jina.ai/deepsearch) | [Evaluation](#evaluation)

Keep searching, reading webpages, reasoning until an answer is found (or the token budget is exceeded). Useful for deeply investigating a query.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unlike OpenAI/Gemini/Perplexity's "Deep Research", we focus solely on **finding the right answers via our iterative process**. We don't optimize for long-form articles, that's a **completely different problem** – so if you need quick, concise answers from deep search, you're in the right place. If you're looking for AI-generated long reports like OpenAI/Gemini/Perplexity does, this isn't for you.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/node-DeepResearch.git
cd node-DeepResearch
pnpm install
```

It is also available on npm but not recommended for now, as the code is still under active development.


## Usage

We use Gemini (latest `gemini-2.0-flash`) / OpenAI / [LocalLLM](#use-local-llm) for reasoning, [Jina Reader](https://jina.ai/reader) for searching and reading webpages, you can get a free API key with 1M tokens from jina.ai.

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...  # for gemini
# export OPENAI_API_KEY=... # for openai
# export LLM_PROVIDER=openai # for openai
export JINA_API_KEY=jina_...  # free jina api key, get from https://jina.ai/reader

npm run dev $QUERY
```

### Official Site

You can try it on [our official site](https://search.jina.ai).

### Official API

You can also use [our official DeepSearch API](https://jina.ai/deepsearch):

```
https://deepsearch.jina.ai/v1/chat/completions
```

You can use it with any OpenAI-compatible client.

For the authentication Bearer, API key, rate limit, get from https://jina.ai/deepsearch.

#### Client integration guidelines

If you are building a web/local/mobile client that uses `Jina DeepSearch API`, here are some design guidelines:
- Our API is fully compatible with [OpenAI API schema](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create), this should greatly simplify the integration process. The model name is `jina-deepsearch-v1`.
- Our DeepSearch API is a reasoning+search grounding LLM, so it's best for questions that require deep reasoning and search.
- Two special tokens are introduced `<think>...</think>`. Please render them with care.
- Citations are often provided, and in [Github-flavored markdown footnote format](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-30-footnotes-now-supported-in-markdown-fields/), e.g. `[^1]`, `[^2]`, ...
- Guide the user to get a Jina API key from https://jina.ai, with 1M free tokens for new API key.
- There are rate limits, [between 10RPM to 30RPM depending on the API key tier](https://jina.ai/contact-sales#rate-limit).

## Demo
> was recorded with `gemini-1.5-flash`, the latest `gemini-2.0-flash` leads to much better results!

Query: `"what is the latest blog post's title from jina ai?"`
3 steps; answer is correct!
![demo1](.github/visuals/demo.gif)

Query: `"what is the context length of readerlm-v2?"`
2 steps; answer is correct!
![demo1](.github/visuals/demo3.gif)

Query: `"list all employees from jina ai that u can find, as many as possible"`
11 steps; partially correct! but im not in the list :(
![demo1](.github/visuals/demo2.gif)

Query: `"who will be the biggest competitor of Jina AI"`
42 steps; future prediction kind, so it's arguably correct! atm Im not seeing `weaviate` as a competitor, but im open for the future "i told you so" moment.
![demo1](.github/visuals/demo4.gif)

More examples:

```

```sh
docker compose run -it --rm api pnpm dev "what is the capital of France?"
```

### Example: 2-step

```sh
docker compose run -it --rm api pnpm dev "what is the latest news from Jina AI?"
```

### Example: 3-step

```sh
docker compose run -it --rm api pnpm dev "what is the twitter account of jina ai's founder"
```

### Example: 13-step, ambiguious question (no def of "big")

```sh
docker compose run -it --rm api pnpm dev "who is bigger? cohere, jina ai, voyage?"
```

### Example: open question, research-like, long chain of thoughts

```sh
docker compose run -it --rm api pnpm dev "who will be president of US in 2028?"
docker compose run -it --rm api pnpm dev "what should be jina ai strategy for 2025?"
```

## Use Local LLM

> Note, not every LLM works with our reasoning flow, we need those who support structured output (sometimes called JSON Schema output, object output) well. Feel free to purpose a PR to add more open-source LLMs to the working list.

If you use Ollama or LMStudio, you can redirect the reasoning request to your local LLM by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
export LLM_PROVIDER=openai  # yes, that's right - for local llm we still use openai client
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1  # your local llm endpoint
export OPENAI_API_KEY=whatever  # random string would do, as we don't use it (unless your local LLM has authentication)
export DEFAULT_MODEL_NAME=qwen2.5-7b  # your local llm model name
```


## OpenAI-Compatible Server API

If you have a GUI client that supports OpenAI API (e.g. [CherryStudio](https://docs.cherry-ai.com/), [Chatbox](https://github.com/Bin-Huang/chatbox)) , you can simply config it to use this server.

![demo1](.github/visuals/demo6.gif)

Start the server:

```bash
# Without authentication
npm run serve

# With authentication (clients must provide this secret as Bearer token)
npm run serve --secret=your_secret_token
```

The server will start on http://localhost:3000 with the following endpoint:

### POST /v1/chat/completions
```bash
# Without authentication
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "jina-deepsearch-v1",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello!"
      }
    ]
  }'

# With authentication (when server is started with --secret)
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_secret_token" \
  -d '{
    "model": "jina-deepsearch-v1",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello!"
      }
    ],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

Response format:
```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1677652288,
  "model": "jina-deepsearch-v1",
  "system_fingerprint": "fp_44709d6fcb",
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "YOUR FINAL ANSWER"
    },
    "logprobs": null,
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 9,
    "completion_tokens": 12,
    "total_tokens": 21
  }
}
```

For streaming responses (stream: true), the server sends chunks in this format:
```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-123",
  "object": "chat.completion.chunk",
  "created": 1694268190,
  "model": "jina-deepsearch-v1",
  "system_fingerprint": "fp_44709d6fcb",
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "delta": {
      "content": "..."
    },
    "logprobs": null,
    "finish_reason": null
  }]
}
```

Note: The think content in streaming responses is wrapped in XML tags:
```
<think>
[thinking steps...]
</think>
[final answer]
```


## Docker Setup

### Build Docker Image
To build the Docker image for the application, run the following command:
```bash
docker build -t deepresearch:latest .
```

### Run Docker Container
To run the Docker container, use the following command:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key --env JINA_API_KEY=your_jina_api_key deepresearch:latest
```

### Docker Compose
You can also use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications. To start the application with Docker Compose, run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

```

## Evaluation

I kept the evaluation simple, LLM-as-a-judge and collect some [ego questions](./src/evals/ego-questions.json) for evaluation. These are the questions about Jina AI that I know 100% the answer but LLMs do not.

I mainly look at 3 things: total steps, total tokens, and the correctness of the final answer.

```bash
npm run eval ./src/evals/questions.json
```

Here's the table comparing plain `gemini-2.0-flash` and `gemini-2.0-flash + node-deepresearch` on the ego set.

Plain `gemini-2.0-flash` can be run by setting `tokenBudget` to zero, skipping the while-loop and directly answering the question.

It should not be surprised that plain `gemini-2.0-flash` has a 0% pass rate, as I intentionally filtered out the questions that LLMs can answer.

| Metric | gemini-2.0-flash | #188f1bb |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Pass Rate | 0% | 75%      |
| Average Steps | 1 | 4        |
| Maximum Steps | 1 | 13       |
| Minimum Steps | 1 | 2        |
| Median Steps | 1 | 3        |
| Average Tokens | 428 | 68,574   |
| Median Tokens | 434 | 31,541   |
| Maximum Tokens | 463 | 363,655  |
| Minimum Tokens | 374 | 7,963    |
